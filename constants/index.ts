Beyond the migration, the reserve is home to the legendary Big Five, cheetahs sprinting across the open plains, and hyenas cackling under the African sky. The Maasai Mara offers an authentic safari experience like no other, blending raw wilderness with cultural encounters with the proud Maasai people.",
